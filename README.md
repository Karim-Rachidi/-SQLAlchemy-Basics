# -SQLAlchemy-Basics
These are the fundamentals to creating a SQL database using Python's SQLAlchemy

This isn't professional!
The models.py file contains a simple Python script that uses the SQLAlchemy 
library to create a SQL database called 'users' with sqlite. 
After creating a users table 3 rows are added.

After setting up a new virtual environment you can use the requirements.txt
file to install the necessary libraries in your terminal.
